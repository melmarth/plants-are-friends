South America.,Height 30 in/75 cm.,Toxic to cats and dogs.,The amaryllis within the growing period (winter – spring) prefers temperatures of 70 – 75F°f (21 – 24°c) and from September – November (or early December) 55°f (13°c). After the plant as flowered the temperature can be kept at around 70 – 75F°f (21 – 24°c) which will keep the flower healthier longer.,Bright light without too much direct sunlight is preferable.,"During the growing and flowering period, water when the top inch of the soil becomes dry. Once the leaves are cut away you can stop watering for about 8 – 10 weeks (dormant period) or water sparingly until new growth appears. When new leaves appear water frequently again when the top inch of soil becomes dry. Overwatering may cause the bulb to rot.",You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden store will offer other suitable options as well.,Your hippeastrum can be re-potted if the bulb seems to have outgrown the pot or every 2 years just before the dormant growing period (Nov – Dec). The pot size needs to be approximatively 2 inches wider each side of the bulb.,After the dormant period (Nov -Dec) begin feeding with a liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks once you begin to see leaf shoots appearing. Continue until the leaves are cut down ready for the dormant period (Sept – Nov).,Normal room humidity is fine.,These can be propagated by seed (takes up to 5 years to mature and flower) or bulb offsets. Propagating with offsets takes about half the time to produce a mature plant that flowers compared to planting seeds (about 3 years).,,Amaryllis, Hippeastrum (botanical/scientific).
Eastern Africa.,Diameter (micro – 3in) – (large – 16in).,Non toxic dogs and cats.,Room temperatures of around 65°f / 16°c — 75°f / 24°c are ideal. Try not to allow temperatures to decrease lower than 60°f / 15.5°c and it’s advised to avoid cold drafts or abrupt temperature changes.,"The African violet thrives in bright light, although too much direct sunlight will cause leaf problems (edges turn yellow, patches, or develop holes). I have grown mine, at best – close to east facing windows, but many other people grow them close to the south facing side. Growers will use artificial lighting to encourage blooms during winter time, using fluorescent lighting tubes. However, many of us do not want to use lighting and have the expense when we are happy enough to see the spring and summer blooms.","Re-pot when needed (room temperature not below 70°F./21°C). I would always do this at least once every year, or even twice a year. There is no need to increase the pot size unless it becomes pot bound or has grown larger.",A fast draining soil mix is best to use. I actually use the African V soil mix with 1 part vermiculite because it’s cheap enough and easy to find in many stores.,"It’s wise to remove dying leaves, flowers and stems as soon as possible to encourage new growth. Remove new side shoots (suckers) as soon as they begin to grow as well. Removing crowns is to be done very carefully.","Fertilize every couple of weeks with a balanced fertilizer that’s urea-free. Or even better, a solution specifically for A.violets.","These need high humidity and plenty of gentle misting (with lukewarm water, not in direct sunlight and only the leaves) for healthy growth and to flower well. You can use a humidity tray to support the correct levels that need to have small pebbles or a layer of gravel at the bottom with water added below the surface.","A.voilets are propagated by leaf cuttings (Chimera AVs only by suckers), placed into a potting mix.",,African violet, Saintpaulia (botanical/scientific) .
South America.,4ft tall or more if not pruned.,Toxic for cats and dogs.,Average room temperatures of 55 – 75°F (13 – 24°C) are best suited for Begonias…and no less than 55°F.,"This plant is not in favor of direct sun. This is because the leaves are sensitive to getting scorched. In their natural habitat, most Begonias grow under cover. Bright light is best and during the winter some morning or late afternoon sun is fine.","From spring to fall you will need to water this plant often, especially while it’s in bloom. Keep the soil moist to the touch slightly, but do not overwater. During winter cut down watering and allow the top soil to become dry to the touch before watering again.",African Violet ready-made potting soil works well. Otherwise use a rich soilless well-draining potting mix.,"While the plant is young I would repot it every year in a pot slightly bigger. Once it matures every 2 years. Clay pots work well because they tend to release moisture easier, preventing root problems from stagnant water. An added benefit of using a clay pot is it will keep the plant more sturdy once it matures in height and prevent it from toppling over.",From spring to fall feed the plant while the soil is damp every 2 weeks. Use a high potassium diluted feed of 5-10-5. This seems to work well in keeping the leaves and flowers looking healthy.,"This plant enjoys a good amount of humidity. You can mist around the plant area, but I advise you not to water the leaves in case it causes spots or patches on them.",You may take a few inches (4 – 6in) or more of stem cuttings with or without a leaf attached and without flowers. You want a node or more on the stem where a new flower will begin to grow. The stem cutting can be placed in water or in perlite (use a rooting hormone with perlite) until growth appears then it can be potted in soil. I prefer to stick with placing it in water to see the roots form. These can also be grown from seed which is much more difficult for the average grower.,,Angel wing begonia, Begonia coccinea (botanical/scientific)

Do not allow standing water in the saucer underneath.",These plants prefer a standard potting soil mixed with bark or pumice at a 1:1 ratio. The pH of the soil chosen needs to be between 5.0 and 7.5 for the continued health of the plant.,"Every two years, this plant requires re-potting and an infusion of new soil. Move the plant to a size larger pot, and mix in new soil to fill the gaps. This should be done when the plant is not flowering.",You may fertilize your plant once every two weeks with a diluted balanced fertilizer. Seaweed based fertilizers have been reported to produce the best results.,"This plant is happy with normal air humidity, as long as its soil is properly moist. If the soil has been allowed to dry out, the leaves and flowers may be misted with a spray bottle to combat dehydration effects.",This plant is propagated either by seed or by dividing rhizomes.

To stand any chance of getting the belladonna lily to flower it’s best to have the plant near a south-facing window, where it can get the most hours of sunshine.","Keep the soil moist (not soaked) during the growing and flowering period. During the rest period after the leaves have died down, do not water until the stalk appears and then begin watering as normal.",You can use equal part perlite and peat or two parts loam soil and one part perlite. Your local garden center may also be able to offer other suitable options. Make sure the bulb is planted within a large plant pot.,Re-pot in a fairly large pot that gives the plant plenty of room for it’s roots. Once every 2 -3 years should be fine.,"Once the leaves appear you can fertilize with a diluted liquid fertilizer once a month. Do not feed during the rest period and begin again once the stalk appears. Feeding will help belladonna lily plants to flower, however, it’s not necessary to do so and it’s much better to give less or none at all – than too much.",Normal room humidity is fine.,"These can be propagated by seed, bulb offsets or rhizome’s.",,"Belladonna lily, March lily and naked lady.", Amaryllis belladonna (botanical/scientific).

Above 70 ºF (21 ºC), this plant should be relocated to a partial shade environment in order to avoid sunburn on the flowers.","During the summer months, the soil should be kept moist through regular watering. Throughout the fall and winter, permit the soil to almost dry out before watering. Never permit water to stand in the saucer underneath the plant.",Strelitzia reginae does well in almost any type of soil. A standard potting soil will suffice for this plant’s continued health.,"Check the roots of this plant in the late winter. If the roots appear to be cramped in the current container, have someone assist you in moving it to a size larger pot. Be careful not to injure the spathe during the transplant process. Also, re-pot young plants which are growing early spring.",Offer this plant a balanced fertilizer every two weeks throughout the spring and summer. During the fall and winter months fertilization to once every month.,"This plant prefers normal air humidity inside the home. During the winter months, you can mist the leaves of the plants to simulate rainfall, which will also improve humidity during the months that artificial heating is used.","The Strelitzia can be propagated from seeds or by division. The seeds are woody, brown and small, with tufts of orange on them. When propagating from seed, it will take the newly formed plant up to three years to begin blooming.

Once a month you can add a diluted liquid fertilizer (half the recommended strength on the instructions) to your misting bottle. Overfeeding can cause leaf color loss.,"You will only need to re-pot if the container used is no longer large enough. It’s worth renewing the soil once a year, but if the soil mix has nutrients added to it – do not feed for the next month or two.","Providing average to above-average humidity is advisable. To improve levels during summer or when artificial heating is used, you can mist the leaves, or provide a humidity tray for the plant and it’s container to sit on. If you notice the leaves turning brown and dry this could be caused by dry air (lack of humidity).","Once the plant has flowered the mother plant will begin to die and produce pups – rather than grow its leaves any further. These offsets are removed and used to create new plants by cutting them off as close to the main plant as possible, usually when they begin to grow roots or they’re about a third of the size of the mother plant.","Once the plant has flowered the mother plant will begin to die and produce pups – rather than grow it’s leaves any further.

The best is medium or filtered light and a room on the southern, eastern or western side. Morning direct sun is fine but not afternoon summer direct sunlight. You can go down the artificial lighting route if required and this is what many professional growers do.","Cattleyas like to dry out between the waterings. The established plants should be watered from a week to ten days, and young plants from five to seven days. To make sure you are doing the best you can, you can place the pot in a bowl of water for 10-15 minutes – this works the best for the plants in clay pots. If your orchid is planted in a plastic pot, put it in an empty bowl and slowly add water. Keep it there for 10-15 minutes. In both cases you can also put the plant in a sink and use tepid water for a minute or so.","They do well in soiless mixtures, for example bark, rocks, or perlite (their roots need air) .

Better to water less than overwater as the effects of less watering are easily resolved and won’t create root rot.","A peat-based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand is a good mix. The medium must drain well and be well aerated, but it requires some kind of water retention for the small roots to absorb nutrients.",Repot only when the plant has outgrown its current pot and only to the next size up with drainage holes. Remember the roots are very small and are not likely to fill most pots. Renewing the soil annually is good practice.,"During spring – while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks, and once a month during summer. No feeding is required after summer until the next spring.","Normal room humidity levels should be fine. Increasing humidity with misting (during summer) and grouping the Peperomia ferreyrae with other plants, especially other peperomias is good practice. If you see signs of lack of humidity and dry air appearing then make efforts to provide extra air moisture.","Taking leaf cuttings is the most common method of propagation. When stem cuttings are taken, allowing a day for the wounds to dry out is good practice for replanting. Try to provide warm temperatures of about 20ºC (68ºF) with bright light and cover cuttings with plastic to encourage growth until you see the first appearance of growth.",,"Pincusion Peperomia, Bean Plant (common name). Peperomia ferreyrae (botanical/scientific name), green bean",
Mexico.,Stems can grow a few feet long.,Not known.,Temperatures averaging 50°F/10°C – 75°F/23.8°C are ideal but not below 40°F/5°C and avoid frost.,"The rat tail cactus thrives on bright light, but not direct sunlight. It also enjoys the warmth of the summer sun while it sits within a shaded area. Some sunlight and shade is great.","It’s advisable to water this plant frequently within the summer and much less winter time. Add water at the top of the pot or container and allow it to seep through to the drainage holes, then remove the excess water from the pot tray. Keeping the soil slightly moist is also advisable within the summer.",A pot mixture used for cactus plants will suffice.,Re-potting every 2 -3 years is advised and when it becomes pot bound. Remember the spines can be prickly so you may want to wear protective gloves while re-potting.,,"Humidity does not seem to be a major concern for the Disocactus flagelliformis, making the average indoor environment fine – as it is.","These are propagated by stem cuttings early summer. When they are cut – you will find – letting them dry for a few days helps the process, because the wounds can heal.",,Rat’s Tail, Aporocactus Flagelliformis or Disocactus flagelliformis (botanical/scientific).
South africa.,Diameter 8in – 20cm approx. Leaves 6in – 15 long.,Not known.,Temperatures averaging 70°F/21°C – 90°F/32°C are very good and not below 50°F/10°C.,"This species is a sun lover and requires 3 hours or more sun to encourage blooms during Fall. During winter shade and less light is fine but, don’t make the mistake of watering too much.",A thorough watering is needed when the top soil is becoming slightly dry to the touch. During winter cut watering down and let the soil dry out much more. A sure way to kill this plant is to overwater it during the winter. Never leave the plant standing in water.,"A cactus potting mix will do the trick and already has the essential nutrients within the soil needed. Your own mix will need to be a non peat based compost, one part course sand – 2 parts soil.",Repot every two years or when the current pot becomes too small. Only move to a pot slightly bigger and use a shallow container because of the small root system. Also make sure the pot has decent drainage holes.,From April – August I would use a weak liquid feed diluted only.,Normal house humidity is fine. Open windows and doors to provide enough air within the room.,One method is to remove pups (offsets) by hand that are attached to the parent plant. Great if you find roots attached because they will begin growing quickly. If there are no roots I would pot up the plant after two days to allow the wound to begin to heal then place in moist soil. After planting offsets I would water once (just to make the soil moist – not wet) then wait to see a slight bit of new growth before watering again and keep the plant away from direct sunlight until this new growth has appeared. This plant can also be propagated with seeds and for the germination process to begin you will temperatures to be between 70°F/21°C – 80°F/26°C (not always easy and successful for the average grower).,,Tiger Jaws, Faucaria Tigrina (botanical/scientific).
South America.,25 – 30 cm or longer trailing stems.,Non-toxic to cats and dogs.,"Ideal temperatures of 65-75ºF (18-24ºC), and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).","Bright light without direct sunlight is best suited. A small amount of morning or evening sun won’t harm, but midday sun could scorch the leaves and harm the plant. South, east or west facing areas are best suited and check if the plant needs to sit further back from the window.",Overwatering is the worst offender for most Peperomias including this species. This is because of its succulent nature and small roots . Allow the soil to become dry then water thoroughly. During the winter reduce watering to a minimum. Better too little than too much.,"A peat based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand is a good mix. Other mixes will work well, but the main point is for the medium to drain well and be well aerated.",The trailing jade rarely requires repotting. A soil or top soil change is a good idea once a year but only repot when the existing pot is much too small. Remember the roots are very small which makes it easy for the soil to become waterlogged and will harm the plant.,"During spring – while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks, and once a month during summer. No feeding is required from autumn to spring","During the summer mist the leaves. As the plant does prefer high humidity, grouping it together with other plants is a good idea. This will increase humidity within the area. If dry air problems occur – make efforts to improve the humidity, but most will be fine with normal indoor humidity levels.","Stem tip and leaf cuttings can both be propagated. Take a few centimeters of stem tip with one or two healthy leaves attached and allow the tip or leaves ‘if taking leaf cuttings’ to dry out for a day, and then plant them in moist peat based potting mix. Try to provide warm temperatures of about 20ºC (68ºF) with bright light. Rooting hormone may be used on the wounds when propagating and a plastic cover over the pot/tray will improve humidity and provide warmth.",,"Trailing jade, round leaf Peperomia", Peperomia rotundifolia (botanical/scientific).
Africa,Height 1cm – 5cm max.,"Not known, but it’s unlikely a pet will chew on this type of foliage, although they could be curious.","The Lithop Pseudotruncatella is a plant that is suitable for a wide range of temperatures ranging from 50°F to 100°F. However, to ensure that the plant receives a stable and consistent temperature it is best to position it in temperatures of around 65°F – 75°F where it will thrive.",It grows extremely well in South or West facing areas due to it needing constant sunlight.,"Once new leaves have developed during the summer the plant can be watered. The pot is almost left to dry out before being watered again and this generally continues through until October. However, during the height of summer it is recommended that the plant is watered a minimum of once a week but during the winter months the plant is kept dry.",Lithops prefer a soil that drains well with very little organic matter. A permeable substrate can be added to the soil along with gravel and sand to improve drainage,The best time to re-pot is prior to its first watering with a well-drained loam-based compost being the best choice.,It will not require fertilization as this only weaken the tissues of the plant which can lead to rot.,Normal room humidity will work fine but air circulation is advisable providing it is not directly placed near a cold draft.,"It is possible to use cuttings but this is not always worthwhile as old plants can become tired looking. Therefore, it is best to propagate by seed that is sown at a temperature of 66-70 °F during the early spring.",,Truncate living stone, Lithops pseudotruncatella (botanical/scientific).
South America.,6 – 12in tall.,Non-toxic to cats and dogs.,"Prefers temperatures of 65-75ºF (18-24ºC), and no lower than 50ºF (10ºC).","A bright room with the plant placed in a shaded spot is ideal, without direct sunlight. In their natural habitat they reside undercover within forests with some sun and shade so we need to try and replicate this. Sitting back from a west, east or even south facing window is best.","It’s important not to water these plants too much or underwater them. Over-watering can cause rot and under-watering will make them wilt. To get watering just about right, allow the soil to dry to the touch at the top and then water thoroughly, but much less during winter.",A peat based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite is a good mix.,"You will not need to re-pot one of these very often as they quite like to be pot bound. After about 3 years you may need to move to a slightly bigger pot, to be done during spring. You can replace the top soil once very spring.",During the spring while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 – 4 weeks until the end of summer.,Average indoor humidity should be fine. You can mist the leaves every now and again during summer months if the air becomes dry. Being around other indoor plants will improve humidity.,The most common and easiest way to propagate a peperomia of this type is by leaf cuttings. Remove leaves with petioles (stalks ) and use rooting hormone on the cut before planting in seedling and cutting compost. About 1 inch of stalk with a leaf should be fine and keep the soil moist and warm.,,Watermelon Peperomia, Peperomia argyreia [Syn. P. sandersii] — (botanical/scientific).
South Africa.,Leaves grow from 4in – 8in tall and the rosette up to about 5in in diameter.,Non-toxic to cats and dogs.,65°F/18°C – 80°F/26°C temperatures are very good and not much below 50°F/10°C.,"Display this plant anywhere it can receive plenty of sun or bright light. South facing windows will provide the most sun, however, east or west provide direct sun part of the day that I find more suitable.","During the growing season from April – September water the plant thoroughly and then water when the soil becomes dry to the touch (not bone dry though). Winter is a tricky time for these plants although they are a tough species. Many growers will overwater then alongside cold temperatures or drafts the plant can become very sick, or even die. The leaves are storage organs so during the winter water much less and allow the top soil to dry out","I would use a cactus potting mix that drains wells and provides plenty of air to the small roots. If making you own mix or buying another type, use part potting soil, part perlite and part sand.","Once the plant outgrows the pot you can repot, during spring. Only move to a slightly bigger pot. Every two years I would renew the soil even if repotting is not required.",From April – Sept you can feed them with a diluted liquid fertilizer once every month. Do not feed during winter.,Normal room humidity will suffice.,"These are propagated in the same way as Aloe plants. Propagate with a couple of inches of leaves, letting the wound heal for a couple of days before planting (let them dry out). They also produce pups (offsets) that can be removed from the mother plant and replanted. Either method you should water the soil once and then wait to see a small sign of new growth to prevent killing them with overwatering.",,Zebra Haworthia or Zebra Cactus, Haworthia Fasciata and Attenuata (botanical/scientific).
